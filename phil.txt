Hi, Phil Swift here for Flex Tape. The super strong waterproof tape that can instantly patch, bond, seal and repair. Flex Tape is no ordinary tape. It's triple thick adhesive virtually welds itself to the surface, instantly stopping the toughest leaks. Leaky pipes can cause major damage, but Flex Tape grips on tight and bonds instantly. Plus, Flex Tape's powerful adhesive is so strong, it even works underwater! Now you can repair leaks in pools and spas without draining them. Flex Tape is perfect for marine, outdoor and camping gear, even make emergency repairs on air mattresses and inflatables! Flex Tape is super strong. And once it's on, it holds on tight. Big storms can cause big damage, but Flex Tape comes super wide, so you can easily patch large holds. To show you the power of Flex Tape, I sawed this boat in half! And repaired it with only Flex Tape! Not only does Flex Tape's powerful adhesive hold the boat together, but it creates a super strong water tight seal! So the inside is completely dry! Yee doggie! Patch, bond, seal and repair. Imagine everything you could do with the power of Flex Tape!
