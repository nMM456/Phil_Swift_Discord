# Phil Swift Discord
My discord bot Phil Swift which has very little support for statistic in OWL

If you decide to run the bot, you can see all available commands by using !help

The primary reason for this bot is to find statistic about the Overwatch League. I also added other features that were important to me or other people in my server such as osu! I hope to add more features to my bot in the future. 

Current general commands are:

  - Minimal Overwatch League support
  
  - osu! statistics
  
  - US Weather support(I plan to add on to this)
  
  - Other useless basic commands that are to irrelevant to list off as of now.

After inputting your API key in server.py, run server.py and the bot should run. The osu! command will also need an api key to function!
